#  2015 EMC Hardware Design Competition 

A step-down switched-mode power converter based on the regulator MC34063A is designed. Special attention is given to the minimization of its conducted emissions and output voltage ripple. The selection of the components and the design of the printed circuit board (PCB) layout are discussed in detail in the work report. The operation of the designed converter is simulated by SPICE simulations. The efficiency, output voltage ripple and conducted emissions of the designed converter are measured.A line impedance stabilization network (LISN) designed on a separate PCB is used for the conducted emission measurements.
